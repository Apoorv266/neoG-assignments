// Write a function that takes a number as input and determines if it is a multiple of 3.
// Return the statement as written in the output.

// Output looks like this:
const isMultipleOfThree = num => num % 3 === 0

console.log(isMultipleOfThree(5)) // 5 is not a multiple of 3
console.log(isMultipleOfThree(9)) // 9 is a multiple of 3
