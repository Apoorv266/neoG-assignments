## Arrow Function 

Arrow function is a syntax introduced in ES6. It is an easier way of writing functions, especially if its a one liner function that returns something.

### Let us first see how a function was created in ES5

Example, The below function takes in a and b as parameters and returns the sum of a and b.  

```
function sum ( a,b ) { 
return a+b; }
```

### Let us see how a function was created in ES6

```
const sum = ( a,b ) => { return a+b; } 
```
